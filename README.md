# AViD Dataset: Anonymized Videos from Diverse Countries

This is an early release of the dataset. The videos and labels are provided, more baseline reults will be added shortly.

AViD is a large-scale video dataset with 470k videos and 895 action classes. Importnatly, AViD has several key attributes:

### Static
The collected videos have a creative-commons license, allowing us to create and distrubte a static dataset. Unlike other YouTube-based datasets (e.g., Kinetics), the dataset is static and easily downloadable enabling reproducable research. We further release this dataset under a flexible MIT license, unlike more restrictive video datasets (e.g., Moments-in-Time and SomethingSomething)

### Anonymized 
All the faces in the videos have been blurred so that no person can be idenntified.

### Diverse
The videos have been collected from a wide range of countries and sources. This is important as some actions, for example greeting, are performed differently in different cultures. Other actions, like news broadcasts, can have different text depending on the country.
